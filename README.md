## Hi there 
# About Me:
Sagar Kumar<br>He/Him<br>Sagar Kumar is an MTech student at the Agrogeoinformatics Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, and a visiting scholar with the Digital Agronomy Research Team at Kansas State University, where he works on data driven digital agriculture applications. His interests include analytics driven digital agriculture, remote sensing for precision agriculture, and farmer oriented decision support systems, with a focus on applying machine learning to agricultural datasets. At DART, he is completing a part of his M.Tech thesis while contributing to ongoing research that links data analytics with real world agronomic challenges. Alongside his academic work, he has been actively involved in student clubs and coordination roles at IIT Guwahati, gaining experience in leadership, teamwork, and research outreach, which has strengthened his interest in the interface of agriculture, data, and agribusiness decision making. He holds a foundation degree in Agricultural Engineering and brings a strong engineering background with hands on interdisciplinary experience. Outside academics, he enjoys farm visits and, as a hodophile, spends his leisure time exploring new places, playing badminton, or watching movies.
